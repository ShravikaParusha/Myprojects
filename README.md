Overview
This project aims to predict air pollution levels using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other atmospheric factors, the model can predict air quality indices or pollutant concentration levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, etc.) for a given location and time. The goal is to provide a tool that can help monitor and predict air quality, which is crucial for public health, environmental sustainability, and urban planning.
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
Develop predictive models for air pollution levels based on historical data.
Identify key factors contributing to air quality degradation.
Provide accurate and timely predictions to inform public health and policy decisions
