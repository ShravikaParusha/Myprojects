Prediction of Air Pollution Using Machine Learning Algorithm: 
This project aims to predict air pollution levels using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other atmospheric factors, the model can predict air quality indices or pollutant concentration levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, etc.) for a given location and time. The goal is to provide a tool that can help monitor and predict air quality, which is crucial for public health, environmental sustainability, and urban planning.'
Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: The raw data undergoes cleaning, missing value imputation, normalization, and feature extraction to ensure the data is ready for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: We extract features that capture the most relevant information regarding air pollution and its predictors, such as temporal and meteorological patterns.
Model Training & Evaluation: Several machine learning models are trained and tested using appropriate performance metrics, such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (for regression tasks)
Accuracy (for classification tasks)
